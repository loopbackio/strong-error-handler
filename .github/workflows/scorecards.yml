# This is separate from the CI workflow due to certain restrictions imposed by the GitHub Action action:
# https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action/tree/99cc02c8ee27bab5f5f41e79066e0de91d313dec#workflow-restrictions
# For consistency, we should keep it a separate workflow across all our Github repositories, regardless if it's actually needed.
